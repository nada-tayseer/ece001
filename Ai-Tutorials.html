                Since the invention of computers or machines, their capability to perform various tasks went on
                growing
                exponentially. Humans have developed the power of computer systems in terms of their diverse working
                domains, their increasing speed, and reducing size with respect to time.

                A branch of Computer Science named Artificial Intelligence pursues creating the computers or
                machines as
                intelligent as human beings.

                What is Artificial Intelligence?
                According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is “The science and
                engineering of
                making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.

                Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software
                think
                intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.
